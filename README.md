<h1>UHSC-mod-repo</h1>
<h3>by GiovanH, forked by Kosinjak</h3>
<p>This fork was created to make the description of Serial appear in UHSC.</p>
<h2>What does each file do</h2>
<b>The descriptions for Oddities and Neko come from the <a href= https://github.com/GiovanH/unofficial-homestuck-collection/wiki/Third-Party-Mods>Third Party mods</a> page.</b>
</br>
<p><b>Serial:</b> this mod will make the length of time between the upload of Homestuck pages appear when you hover the 'next' button</p>
<p><b>Oddities:</b> a mod that enables minor arcane features and tweaks in the collection app</p>
<p><b>Neko:</b> gives you a little friend on your page.</p>
<p><b>Zobocom:</b> this appears to be a test Gio made for modding in browser pages</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>For the one file mods, make a folder in your mods folder and place the .js file inside it. Rename the .js file to mod.js to make it appear in your UHSC settings page.</p>
